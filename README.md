talks-may14
===========

This can be an easy way for us to learn more about using git and participate in an upcoming lightning talk. We all benefit from being in the group, this gives us all a chance to share something you have learned recently. 

To get started. Go to your Terminal or GUI for git and clone this repo down to your workspace. This will create a folder named `talks-may14` all files will be in there.

    $ git clone git@github.com:EasternCTWD/talks-may14.git

Create a branch to work from (replace "*my_branch_name*" with your own branch name. Your username/name would work fine)

    $ git branch my_branch_name
    $ git checkout my_branch_name

While you are working, commit your work often and push it up to the server in your branch.

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "my_commit_message"
    $ git push origin my_branch_name

Once you have pushed all your changes up to your branch on github you need to create a pull-request for your changes. That will send me a message to merge your branch into the master branch.

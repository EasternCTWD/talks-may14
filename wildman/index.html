				<h3>I decided to add Bourbon Neat and SASS to our test site.</h3>
				<p>Using CodeKit I added the Bourbon Neat files to the project. My motivation was because I wanted to start styling the website but before that I wanted to set up a responsive grid. I also added SASS because I dug around at the LESS files in the bootstrap that Jay installed and made no sense of it</p>

				<h3>First topic:</h3> 
				<h4>I was recently asked to add a form/discussion board and a chat room to an exsisting WordPress client site. Then have both new features in a members only area. None of which I had done before.</h4> 
				<h5>So how did that go you ask?</h5>
